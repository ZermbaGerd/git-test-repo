# Chapter 1

It was a typical Monday morning for Marvin, a short man with a passion for routine and simplicity. As he walked into his local bank to make a deposit, he was greeted by the usual familiar faces of the bank tellers. However, today was going to be different.

As Marvin approached the counter, he noticed a new teller, a young woman with striking red hair and a bold sense of style. She looked down at Marvin with a critical eye, sizing him up from head to toe. Marvin felt a pang of self-consciousness as he realized that his plain, button-down shirt and khaki trousers were not as flashy as the teller's brightly colored outfit.

"Excuse me, sir," the teller said, her tone slightly condescending. "I couldn't help but notice that you seem to have a rather...boring wardrobe. Have you considered spicing things up a bit?"

Marvin was taken aback by her bluntness. He had always prided himself on his simplicity and practicality when it came to clothing. He didn't see the point in spending time and money on flashy outfits when he had more important things to worry about, like his job and his family.

"I'm sorry, I don't really see the need for flashy clothes," Marvin replied, his voice calm but firm. "I prefer to keep things simple and understated."

The teller raised an eyebrow, clearly not satisfied with Marvin's answer. "But don't you want to make a statement? Stand out from the crowd? Express yourself through your clothing?"

Marvin sighed, feeling slightly irritated by the teller's persistence. He had never been one to seek attention or approval from others, especially not through his appearance. He just wanted to go about his day as usual, without being judged for his choice of clothing.
