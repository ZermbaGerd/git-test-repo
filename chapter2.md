# Chapter 2

"I appreciate your concern, but I'm quite content with how I dress," Jonathan said, trying to end the conversation politely.

The teller seemed to sense that she was getting nowhere with Jonathan, so she reluctantly turned her attention back to processing his transaction. As Jonathan waited for his receipt, he couldn't shake the feeling of being judged for something as trivial as his clothing.

As he left the bank and made his way back home, Jonathan couldn't help but dwell on the encounter with the teller. He couldn't understand why she felt the need to criticize his wardrobe choices, especially when he had always been courteous and respectful towards her.

When he arrived home, Jonathan decided to confide in his wife, Megan, about what had transpired at the bank. Megan listened attentively as Jonathan recounted the encounter with the teller, her expression a mix of sympathy and amusement.

"I can't believe she had the nerve to say that to you," Megan exclaimed, shaking her head in disbelief. "You've always had such a classic sense of style, Jonathan. Don't let her comments get to you."

Jonathan felt a surge of gratitude towards Megan for her unwavering support. She had always been his rock, his pillar of strength in times of doubt and uncertainty. Her words of encouragement gave him the courage to brush off the teller's remarks and focus on what truly mattered in life.
