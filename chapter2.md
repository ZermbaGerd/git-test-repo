# Marvin Turns The Other Cheek

The next day, Marvin returned to the bank to make another deposit. As luck would have it, the same teller was working at the counter. Marvin approached her with a newfound sense of confidence, determined not to let her words affect him.

"Good morning," Marvin said, flashing a warm smile at the teller. "I hope you're having a great day."

The teller looked up from her paperwork, her expression one of surprise. She had expected Marvin to be resentful or defensive after their previous encounter, but instead, he seemed genuinely friendly and composed.

"Good morning," the teller replied, her tone slightly sheepish. "I'm sorry if I upset you with my comments the other day. I didn't mean to be rude."

Marvin waved her apology away with a dismissive gesture. "No need to apologize. We all have our own unique preferences when it comes to clothing. What matters most is how we carry ourselves with confidence and grace."
